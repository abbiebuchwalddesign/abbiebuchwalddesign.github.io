        <img src="AGDIHistory.png" id="history" alt="A Great Day In is a music festival showcasing local musicians and artisans, currently taking place in Boston. Yazi Ferrufino, a Boston native and concert photographer, founded this festival with a dream of an inclusive space for emerging musicians to share their art with their community. 

        Before A Great Day in Boston, there was A Great Day in Harlem. In 1958, young photographer Art Kane called all of the jazz greats of the time to come together and take a photograph. He expected maybe ten or twenty to show up, but fifty-seven of his jazz idols all came together for this photograph.It was a raucus reunion for many, and an exciting introduction for others.It involved the community as well, including the line of neighborhood kids sitting in front.
        This image represents community, inclusivity, and artistry through the power of photography. The iconic talent in this photo has its roots on these stairs on a front porch in Harlem. We hope to create this community once more, allowing artists to rise 
and share their work with their communities. We want this to be accessible to all-easy to access, low cost, and a variety of genres for all different music listeners. AGDI has 
the ability to expand and move to different cities, countries, communities. ">

            LOGOMARK: AGDI acronym, the G and D forming a circle to suggest a community, with a gap at the bottom to let new people in. The I turns into a bracket, which expands and opens the mark to the inclusion of new spaces. In its circular form, the mark looks like a record, another tie back to its roots.

These icons can be reinterpreted to include new artists, the brand is a framework for inclusion of outside artists and creatives. One of the most important icons is the staircase. This represents the porch that the musicians in “A Great Day in Harlem” stood on, a space for them to create and collaborate above the streets of Harlem.
        This icon is used in environmental design 
        for various venues, as a decorative element, and on various merch designs. It sparks conversation and invited people in.   ">
